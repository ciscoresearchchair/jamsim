The [Ascape](http://ascape.sourceforge.net/) agent based modelling toolkit is used by JAMSIM as the main GUI and for simulation control (stop, start, pause) etc.

Ascape has been modified for use in JAMSIM in the following ways:
  * the Navigator (the tree on the left side of the Ascape GUI) can be used to display parameter files/datasets and output tables
  * an interactive [R](RStats.md) console has been embedded as a tab at the bottom of the GUI screen
