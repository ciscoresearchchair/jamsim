Slightly modified version of Sun Checks (Eclipse) with:  - Hidden fields allowed, Final parameters allowed, Design for extension ignored (methods don't have to be final), Visibilty Modifiers - allow protected fields in classes, Inline conditionals allowed. Allow @throws for runtime exceptions. Private variables & methods do not need to be commented. Allow underscore in local variable and member names.
